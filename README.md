# growing_revenue

I led projects that were directly tied to growing a client from a 5-figure test campaign to multiple 6-figure deals.

1) The lynch-pin of the first 5-figure test campaign was being able to identify users in our base that had interest in specific topics. Identifying these users was possible bc of a project that:
- ELT'd genre, topic and keyword info from iMDB, TMDB and google books into snowflake
- Developing dimension tables for titles that containing genres, topics and keywords
- Pushing the resulting dimension table to mixpanel for easy access

2) I determined that media placements in our newsletters were leading to eCPA's for the client that were 25% below their expected

3) To help grow revenue from this client, I conceptualized and named a custom product.
- The concept broadly speaking was "health, wellness & personal-development"
- Identified over 1.5M users with interest in this topic (using the data provided in step 1)
- Coined the name "Growthlist" for the custom product which was ultimately the winning idea. Designs shown below.
